objects and arrays

On initiate send the null board and the randomly assigned first player (with space for players to choose the first player assignment down the track).
The player then chooses a square.
Send that choice only.
One function receives the move.
From there you just need a board (array), to keep track of the player moves (switching function), and to check if someone has won (isWinner function).
Need to send back the board, the player move, and a decremental counter to give an idea how many plays remaining.
